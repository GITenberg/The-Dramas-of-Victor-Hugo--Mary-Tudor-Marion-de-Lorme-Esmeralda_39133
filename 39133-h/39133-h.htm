<h3>FIRST DAY</h3>

<p class="center">A MAN OF THE PEOPLE</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene.</span>&#8212;<i>Border of the Thames. A deserted strand. An old parapet in
ruins, conceals the borders of the water. To the right, a house of
mean appearance. At the corner of this house, a statuette of the
Virgin, at whose feet burns a wick in an iron lattice. In the
background, beyond the Thames, London. Two high buildings are
seen&#8212;the Tower of London and Westminster. The sun is setting</i></p>



<h4>SCENE I</h4>


<p class="scene"><i>Several men are grouped here and there on the Strand, among whom are
<span class="sc">Simon Renard, John Bridges, Baron Chandos, Robert Clinton, Anthony
Brown, Viscount of Montague</span></i></p>


<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>You are right, my lord, this damned Italian must have bewitched the
Queen. She can't exist without him; she lives only for him, finds
pleasure only in him, listens only to him. If a day passes without
seeing him, her eyes droop as they did when she loved Cardinal Polus,
you remember?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>She is very much in love, it is true, and, consequently, very
jealous.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>The Italian has bewitched her.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD MONTAGUE.</p>

<p>For a fact, they say that people of his nationality have philters for
that purpose.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>The Spanish are clever at poisons which kill people, the Italians are
clever at poisons which make people fall in love.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>Then Fabiani is Spanish and Italian, at the same time. The Queen is
in love and is ill. He has made her drink both.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD MONTAGUE.</p>

<p>As to that, is he really Spanish or Italian?</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>It appears certain that he was born in Italy, in the Capitanate, and
that he was brought up in Spain. He claims to be connected with a
great Spanish family. Lord Clinton has the story at his finger-tips.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>An adventurer&#8212;neither Spanish nor Italian, and still less English,
thank God! These men without a country have no pity on a country,
when they become powerful.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD MONTAGUE.</p>

<p>Didn't you say the Queen was ill, Chandos? That does not hinder her
from leading a very gay life with her favorite!</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>A gay life! A gay life! The people weep while the Queen laughs and
the favorite is gorged. This man eats silver and drinks gold! The
Queen has given him the estates of Lord Talbot, the great Lord
Talbot! The Queen has made him Earl of Clanbrassil and Baron of
Dinasmonddy, this Fabiano Fabiani who says he belongs to the Spanish
family of Peñalver, and who lies when he says it. He is an English
peer like you, Montague, like you, Chandos, like Stanley, like
Norfolk, like myself, like the King! He has the garter, the same as
the Infante of Portugal, as the King of Denmark, as Thomas Percy,
seventh Earl of Northumberland. And what a tyrant is this tyrant who
rules us from his bed! Never did such a curse rest upon England! And
yet I have seen much&#8212;I, who am old! There are seventy new gallows at
Tyburn; the stakes are always embers and never ashes; the
executioner's ax is sharp every morning and blunted every night.
Every day some great nobleman is slaughtered; the day before
yesterday it was Blantyre, yesterday Northcurry, to-day South-Reppo,
to-morrow Tyrconnel. Next week it will be you, Chandos, and next
month it will be I. My lords, my lords, it is shameful and outrageous
that all these honest English heads should fall to please a miserable
adventurer who does not even belong to our country! It is a frightful
and unbearable thing, to think that a Neapolitan favorite can drag as
many blocks as he likes from under this Queen's bed. These two lead a
gay life, you say? By Heaven, it is infamous! Ah, they lead a gay
life, these lovers, while the headsman, at their door, makes widows
and orphans! Oh, their Italian guitar is too well accompanied by the
clank of chains! Madame Queen! you send to the chapel of Avignon for
your singers; every day in your palace, you have comedies, plays, and
a stage crowded with musicians! Upon my life, madame, less joy at
your house and less mourning at ours, if you please; fewer dancers
there, and fewer executioners here; fewer farces at Westminster, and
fewer scaffolds at Tyburn!</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD MONTAGUE.</p>

<p>Have a care, my Lord Clinton! We are loyal subjects! Not a word
against the Queen, everything against Fabiani.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD (<i>laying his hand on <span class="sc">Lord Clinton's</span> shoulder</i>).</p>

<p>Have patience!</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>Patience! That is easy enough for you to say, Mr. Simon Renard! You
are bailiff of Amont in Franche-Comte, subject of the Emperor, and
his embassador at London. You represent the Prince of Spain, the
Queen's future husband. Your person is sacred to the favorite. But it
is different with us. You see, for you, Fabiani is the lover; for us
he is the butcher! [<i>It is night.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>This man troubles me as much as you! You tremble only for your life.
I tremble for my power. That means much more. I do not talk; I act. I
feel less anger than you, perhaps, but I feel more hate. I will
destroy the favorite.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD MONTAGUE.</p>

<p>Yes! but how to do it! I think of it all day.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>It is not in the daytime that the favorites of queens are made and
unmade; it is at night.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>This night is dark and frightful.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>I find it good for what I wish to do.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>What do you mean to do?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>You shall see. My Lord Chandos, when a woman reigns, caprice reigns.
Politics are no longer a matter of calculation then, but of chance.
You can count upon nothing. To-day does not logically bring
to-morrow. Public affairs are no longer like a game of chess, but a
game of cards.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>That is all very well; but let us come to the point. When will you
deliver us from the favorite? Time is pressing. To-morrow Tyrconnel
will be beheaded.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>If I find the man I am looking for, to-night, Tyrconnel will sup with
you to-morrow.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>What do you mean? What will have become of Fabiani?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Have you good eyes, my lord?</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>Yes, although I am old and the night is dark.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Do you see London on the other side of the water?</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>Yes. Why?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Look well! From here you can see the height and the depth of every
favorite's fortune&#8212;Westminster and the Tower of London.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>If God is with me, there is a man who at this moment is yet there
[<i>pointing to Westminster</i>], and who to-morrow, at the same time,
will be here [<i>pointing to the Tower</i>].</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

<p>Pray God be with you!</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD MONTAGUE.</p>

<p>The people hate him no less than we do. What a festival will his fall
make in London!</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>We have placed ourselves in your hands, Sir Bailiff. Dispose of us.
What must we do?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD (<i>indicating a house, near to the water</i>).</p>

<p>You all see that house. It is the house of Gilbert the engraver. Do
not lose sight of it. Now go away with your people, but don't go too
far. Above all, do nothing without me.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>It is agreed. [<i>They all exit at different sides.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD (<i>alone</i>).</p>

<p>The man I need is not easy to find.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He exits. <span class="sc">Jane</span> and <span class="sc">Gilbert</span> enter, arm in arm; they go toward
the house. <span class="sc">Joshua Farnaby</span>, enveloped in a long cloak, accompanies
them.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="scene"><span class="sc">Jane, Gilbert, Joshua Farnaby</span></p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>I must leave you here, my good friends. It is midnight, and I must go
back to my post of turnkey of the Tower of London. I am not as free
as you are, you see! A turnkey is only another kind of prisoner!
Good-by, Jane! Good-by, Gilbert. Ah, my friends, how glad I am to see
you happy! When is the wedding, Gilbert?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>In one week, isn't it, Jane?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Faith! day after to-morrow is Christmas. This is the day of good
wishes and presents. But I have nothing to wish you. It would be
impossible to wish more beauty to the bride or more love to the
bridegroom. You are fortunate.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Good Joshua! And you, are you not happy?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Neither happy nor unhappy. As for me, I have given up everything.
Look you, Gilbert [<i>opening his cloak and disclosing a bunch of keys
hanging to his belt</i>], prison keys always jingling at your side, talk
to you, suggest all sorts of philosophical ideas to you. When I was
young, I was like the rest&#8212;in love for a day, ambitious for a month,
mad a whole year. It was during the reign of Henry VIII. that I was
young. Strange man that Henry VIII.! A man who changed his wives as a
woman changes her dresses. He repudiated the first, had the second
beheaded, had the third's womb cut open; as for the fourth, he had
mercy on her&#8212;he sent her off; but for revenge he had the fifth's
head cut off! This isn't the story of Bluebeard I am telling you, my
beautiful Jane; it is the history of Henry VIII. In those days I
interested myself in the religious wars; I fought first for one side
and then for the other. That was the wisest thing to do. The whole
business was very ticklish. It was whether to be for or against the
Pope. The King's officers hanged those who were for, but they burned
those who were against. The neutral people&#8212;those who neither were
for nor against&#8212;they hanged them or they burned them
indiscriminately. We managed as we could. Yes, the rope; no, the
fagot. I, who am speaking to you, I smelled of burning very often,
and I am not sure that I was not un-hanged two or three times. Those
were great times; very much like the times now. The devil take me if
I know now whom I fought for or what I fought about. If people speak
to me now about Master Luther and Pope Paul III., I shrug my
shoulders. You see, Gilbert, when a man has gray hairs he shouldn't
go back to the opinions he fought for nor the women he loved when he
was twenty. The women and the opinions will seem very ugly, very old,
very paltry, very silly, very much wrinkled and out of date. Such is
my history. Now I am through with public affairs. I am no longer the
King's soldier nor the Pope's soldier; I am jailer of the Tower of
London. I don't fight any more for anybody, and I put everybody under
lock and key. I am turnkey and I am old. I have one foot in a prison
and the other in the grave. I am the one who picks up the remnants of
all the ministers and favorites who go to pieces in the Queen's
palace. It is very amusing. I have also a little child whom I love,
and you both whom I love too; and if you are happy, I am happy also.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>If that is the case, you can be happy; can't he, Jane?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>I can't do anything to add to your happiness, but Jane can do
everything. You love her. I may never be able to do anything for you.
Fortunately for you, you are not high and mighty enough to ever need
the help of the turnkey of the Tower of London. Jane will pay my debt
at the same time that she pays her own, because she and I owe
everything to you. Jane was but a poor child, a forsaken orphan; you
took her home and brought her up. I was drowning in the Thames, one
fine day, and you dragged me out of the water.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Why do you always talk about that, Joshua?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>In order to tell you that our duty, Jane's and mine, is to love you.
I, as a brother; and she, not as a sister.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>No, as a woman. I understand you, Joshua. [<i>She sinks back into her
reverie.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Look at her, Joshua! Is she not beautiful and attractive, and is she
not worthy of a king? If you only knew! You cannot imagine how I love
her!</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Be careful! It is dangerous. A woman should not be loved so much as
that. With a child, it is different.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Nothing. I will be at your wedding next week. I hope State affairs
will leave me a little liberty then, and that everything will be
finished.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>How? What will be finished?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Ah, these things do not interest you, Gilbert. You are in love; you
belong to the people. What do the intrigues of the high-born matter
to you, who are happy among the low-born? But since you ask me, I
will tell you that within one week, perhaps within twenty-four hours,
it is hoped that Fabiano Fabiani's place near the Queen will be
filled by another.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Who is Fabiano Fabiani?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>The Queen's lover: a very celebrated and a very fascinating
favorite&#8212;a favorite who has had his enemies' heads chopped off with
greater dispatch than a procuress can repeat an "Ave"; the best
favorite that the executioner of the Tower of London has had for ten
years. For you must know that every great lord's head that falls,
brings in ten silver crowns to the executioner&#8212;sometimes twice as
much, when the head is very distinguished. The fall of this Fabiani
is greatly desired; though, I must say, during my duties at the
Tower, it is only the bad-tempered people whom I hear find fault with
him&#8212;the discontented people; those whose heads are to fall next
month.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Let the wolves rend each other! What do we care about the Queen and
the Queen's favorite? Isn't it so, Jane?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>There is a big conspiracy against Fabiani; if he escapes, he will be
lucky. I should not be surprised if they were to strike some blow
to-night. I just saw Master Simon Renard prowling about here, very
much absorbed.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Who is Master Simon Renard?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Is it possible that you don't know? He is the Emperor's right hand at
London. The Queen is to marry the Prince of Spain, and Simon Renard
is his embassador to her. The Queen hates him, this Simon Renard; but
she is afraid of him, and she can't do anything to him. He has
already destroyed two or three favorites. It seems to be his instinct
to destroy favorites. He clears up the palace from time to time. He
is a shrewd and spiteful man; he knows all that goes on, and he digs
two or three subterranean rows of intrigues under every event. As for
Lord Paget&#8212;didn't you ask me who was Lord Paget?&#8212;he is a crafty
nobleman who helped to manage affairs under Henry VIII. He is a
member of the secret council. He has such an ascendency that the
other ministers do not dare to breathe in his presence&#8212;except,
however, the chancellor, my Lord Gardiner, who detests him. A violent
man, this Gardiner, and well born. As for Paget, he was nobody&#8212;a
cobbler's son. He is to be made Baron Paget of Beaudesert in
Stafford.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>How glibly he tells all these things, this Joshua.</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>My faith! It's from hearing the prisoners of State talk.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i><span class="sc">Simon Renard</span> appears at the back of stage.</i></p>

<p>You see, Gilbert, the man who knows most about the history of these
times is the turnkey of the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Simon Renard (<i>who overhears these last words</i>).</p>

<p>You are mistaken, my master; it is the executioner!</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA (<i>low to <span class="sc">Gilbert</span> and <span class="sc">Jane</span></i>).</p>

<p>Let us move back a little!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i><span class="sc">Simon Renard</span> goes off slowly; when he has disappeared.</i></p>

<p>That is Master Simon Renard himself.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I don't like to have all these men prowling about my house.</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>What the devil is he doing here? I must hurry back; I think he is
getting work ready for me. Good-by, Gilbert! Good-by, my beautiful
Jane, I knew you when you were no bigger than that, all the same!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Good-by, Joshua! What are you hiding there under your cloak?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>I've got my conspiracy, too!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>What conspiracy?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>O lover who forgets everything else! I have just reminded you that
the day after to-morrow is the time for Christmas presents. The
nobles are plotting a surprise for Fabiani. Well, I am plotting a
surprise too. The Queen may give herself the present of a brand-new
favorite. I am going to give my child a doll. [<i>He takes a doll from
his cloak.</i>] Brand-new, too! We will see which will be the first to
break her toy. God keep you, my friends.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Good-by, Joshua!</p>

<p class="staging">[<span class="sc">Joshua</span> <i>departs</i>. <span class="sc">Gilbert</span> <i>takes</i> <span class="sc">Jane's</span> <i>hand and kisses it
with passion</i>.</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA (<i>from back of stage</i>).</p>

<p>How wise is Providence! She gives to each one his plaything. The doll
to the child, the child to the man, the man to the woman, and the
woman to the devil. [<i>Exits.</i></p>

<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="scene sc">Gilbert, Jane</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I must go, too. Good-by, Jane: sleep well.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>You are not coming in with me to-night, Gilbert?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I can't. You know, I told you before, Jane, I have some work to do in
my shop to-night. I must engrave the handle of a dagger for some Lord
Clanbrassil, whom I have never seen, and who wants it to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Then good-night, Gilbert. Until to-morrow!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>No, Jane, wait a moment. Heaven! how it hurts me to leave you, even
for a few hours. How true it is that you are my life and my joy. Yet
I have to work&#8212;we are so poor. I won't go in, because I should stay;
and yet I can't leave you, weak man that I am. Let us sit down by the
door a few moments, on this bench. I think it will be easier to go
from here than if I went into the house, and, above all, into your
room. Give me your hand.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He sits and takes her hands in his; she stands.</i></p>

<p>Jane, do you love me?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Oh, I owe you everything, Gilbert. I know it, although you have
concealed it from me a long time! When I was little, almost in my
cradle, my parents abandoned me, and you took me. For sixteen years
your hand has worked for me as if you were a father; your eyes have
watched over me like a mother. What would I be without you, just
Heaven! All I have, you have given me; all I am, you have made me.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Jane, do you love me?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>What devotion yours has been, Gilbert! You work for me, night and
day; you wear your eyes out, you kill yourself for me. You are going
to sit up all night again to-night. And never a reproach to me, never
an unkindness, never an angry word! You are very poor, yet you
remember all my small womanly vanities; you gratify them. Gilbert,
whenever I think about you, my eyes fill with tears. You have often
gone without bread; I have never gone without my ribbons.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Jane, do you love me?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Gilbert, I would like to kneel down and kiss your feet.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Do you love me, do you love me? All that does not prove that you love
me. I want that word, Jane! Gratitude, always gratitude! Oh, I stamp
it underfoot, your gratitude. I want love or nothing! Die! Jane, you
have been my daughter for sixteen years; now you are to be my wife. I
adopted you; now I am to marry you&#8212;in one week. You know, you
promised me; you have consented; you are my betrothed. You loved me
when you promised that. Oh, Jane, there was a time&#8212;do you remember
it?&#8212;when you told me, "I love you," and you lifted your sweet eyes
to heaven. That is the way I want you to be. For some months now, you
have seemed different, especially during these last three weeks that
my work has kept me away from here nights. Jane, I must have you love
me! I am used to it. You were always so light-hearted; now you are
sad and absent-minded&#8212;not cold, my poor child (you try your best not
to be), but I feel your loving words do not come as tenderly and as
naturally as they used. What is the matter? Don't you love me any
more? I know I am an honest man, I know I am a good workman; but I
would rather be a robber and an assassin, and be loved by you. Jane,
if you knew how much I love you!</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>I know it, Gilbert, and it makes me weep.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>For joy, isn't it? Say it is for joy! Oh, I need to believe it. There
is only that in the world&#8212;to be loved. I have only a poor
workingman's heart, but my Jane must love me. Why do you always talk
to me about what I have done for you? One single word of love from
you puts all the gratitude on my side. I will damn myself and commit
a crime, whenever you wish it. You will be my wife, won't you, and
you love me? Oh, Jane, for one look of your eyes I would give my work
and my labor; for one smile, my life; for one kiss, my soul.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>What a noble heart you have, Gilbert.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Listen to me, Jane&#8212;laugh at me if you will; I am mad, I am jealous!
I will tell you why. Do not get angry! It seems to me, for some time
I have seen several young lords prowling around here. Do you know,
Jane, I am thirty-two years old. For a poor, clumsy, badly-dressed
workman like myself, who am no longer young, who am not handsome,
what a misery it is to love a charming, beautiful girl of seventeen,
who attracts all the handsome, gold-bedizened young nobles around
her, as a light attracts the butterflies. Oh, I suffer; indeed, I do!
But I never blame you, even in my thoughts! You, so honest, so pure;
you, whose brow has never been touched, except by my lips. I only
feel, sometimes, that you look on the Queen's cavalcades and retinues
with too much pleasure, that you enjoy too much the fine suits of
velvet and satin, under which there are no hearts, no souls. Forgive
me. My God! why do so many young noblemen come around here? Why am I
not handsome, young, noble, rich? Gilbert the engraver&#8212;that is all I
am! They are Lord Chandos, Lord Gerard Fitz-Gerard, Earl of Arundel,
the Duke of Norfolk! Oh, how I hate them! I spend my life engraving
the handles of their swords, which I would like to plunge into their
bowels.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Gilbert!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Jane! Love makes us very wicked, doesn't it?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>No, very good; for you are good, Gilbert.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Oh, how much I love you! It increases every day. I would like to die
for you! Love me or not, you can do as you please. I am mad. Forgive
all that I have said. It is late: I must leave you! Good-by! Oh, how
I hate to leave you! Go in! Haven't you your key?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>No; I haven't had it for several days.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Take mine. Until to-morrow morning! Jane, don't forget this! To-day I
am still your father: in one week I shall be your husband.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He kisses her on the forehead and exits.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>alone</i>).</p>

<p>My husband! Oh, no! I will never commit that crime. Poor Gilbert! he

<p>Yes, I recognize you; you are the Jewish beggar who has been prowling

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Because what I have to say to you, I can only say here.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Well, what is it? Speak! Hurry!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Listen, young man. One night, sixteen years ago, Lord Talbot, Earl of
Waterford, was beheaded by torchlight, for the crimes of popery and
rebellion, while his followers were cut to pieces in the city of
London by Henry VIII.'s soldiers. They shot in the streets all night.
That night a very young workman, who was much more interested in his
labor than in the battle, was working in his stall. It was the first
stall from the entrance of London Bridge; a low door on the right,
the remains of some old red paint on the wall. It might have been two
o'clock in the morning. They were fighting all around there. The
balls hissed across the Thames. Suddenly some one knocked at the door
of the stall, through which the workman's lamp threw a glimmer. The
workman opened it. A man he did not know, entered. This man carried
in his arms a baby in long clothes, who was much frightened and was
crying. The man put the child down on the table and said, "Here is a
creature who has neither father nor mother." Then he went out slowly
and closed the door after him. Gilbert, the workman, had neither
father nor mother himself. The workman accepted the child: the orphan
adopted the orphan. He took it, watched over it, clothed it, fed it,
tended it, brought it up, loved it. He gave himself entirely to this
poor little creature whom civil war had thrown into his stall. He
forgot everything for her&#8212;his youth, his love-affairs, his
pleasures; he made this child the sole object of his work, his
affections, his life: and it has lasted sixteen years. Gilbert, the
workman was you; the child&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Was Jane. All that you say is true; but what are you driving at?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that on the child's swaddling-clothes a paper was
pinned, on which was written: "Have pity upon Jane."</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>It was written in blood. I have kept that paper. I always carry it
about me. But you torture me. What is your purpose, tell me.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>This. You see that I am acquainted with your affairs. Gilbert, watch
over your house to-night.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Not another word. Don't go to your work; stay around the house:
watch! I am neither your friend nor your enemy; this is only a piece
of advice that I give you. Now, for your own sake, leave me! Go down
that side, and come back if you hear me call for help.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>What does this mean? [<i>Goes off slowly.</i></p>

<p>You know my name? That isn't true.</p>

<p>I am going nowhere in particular.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, my lord! You are going to see the fair Jane, the betrothed
of Gilbert the engraver.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p>The devil! This is a dangerous man.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you more? You have seduced this girl, and during the
last month she has received you twice in her house at night. This is
the third time. The beauty is waiting for you.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Keep still. Do you want hush-money? How much do you want?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>We will see about that by-and-by. Now, my lord, shall I tell you why
you have seduced this girl?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>By my faith! because I was in love with her.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>No. You were not in love with her.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>I wasn't in love with Jane.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>No more than with the Queen! Love, oh, no! calculation, yes.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Why, fool, you are no man at all! You are my conscience dressed up
like a Jew.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>I will speak to you as if I were your conscience. This is your plan.
You are the Queen's favorite. The Queen has given you the garter, an
earldom, and a lordship&#8212;empty things, all of them. The garter is a
rag; the earldom is a word; the lordship is the right to have your
head cut off. You wanted something more. You wanted fine lands, fine
bailiwicks, fine castles, fine revenues in fine English pounds. Well,
King Henry VIII. confiscated the estates of Lord Talbot, who was
beheaded sixteen years ago. You got Queen Mary to give you Lord
Talbot's estates. But, to make the gift valid, it is necessary that
Lord Talbot should have died without heirs. And since Lord Talbot
died for Queen Mary and for her mother, Catherine of Aragon, since
Lord Talbot was a Papist, and since the Queen is a Papist, it is not
at all doubtful, if there existed such an heir or an heiress, that
Queen Mary would take back the estates from you, great favorite
though you are, and out of duty, gratitude and religion, return them
to the heir or heiress. You were quite easy on that score, for Lord
Talbot had never had but one little daughter; she disappeared from
her cradle at the time of her father's execution, and all England
believed her to be dead. But your spies have lately discovered that
during the night in which Lord Talbot and his partisans were
exterminated by Henry VIII., a child was mysteriously brought to an
engraver on London Bridge, and that it was probable that this child,
reared under the name of Jane, was Jane Talbot, the little girl who
had disappeared. It is true that the written proofs of her birth were
lacking, but they might be found any day. The discovery was
unpleasant. It would be hard to see one's self forced some day to
give back Shrewsbury, Wexford, which is a fine city, and the
magnificent earldom of Waterford, to a little girl! What was to be
done? You searched for a way to set aside this young girl, and to
destroy her. An honest man would have had her killed or poisoned.
You, my lord, have done better&#8212;you have dishonored her.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Insolent fool!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>It is your conscience which is speaking, my lord. Another man would
have taken this young girl's life; you have taken her honor, and,
consequently, her future. Queen Mary is a prude, although she has
lovers herself.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>This man goes to the bottom of everything.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>The Queen's health is bad; the Queen may die, and then you, the
favorite, will fall shattered on her tomb. The actual proofs of this
young girl's rank may be found; and then, if the Queen is dead, Jane
Talbot, dishonored though she be, will be recognized as Lord Talbot's
heiress. You have foreseen that too. You are a handsome young
cavalier; you have won her love; she has given herself to you; at the
worst, you can marry her. Don't deprecate your scheme, my lord; I
consider it sublime. If I were not myself, I would like to be you.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>You have managed the matter very skillfully. You have concealed your
name. You are safe as far as the Queen is concerned. The poor girl
thinks she has been seduced by a nobleman from Somerset county, named
Amyas Pawlet.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>All&#8212;he knows it all! Well, come to the point. What do you want of
me?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>My lord, suppose some one had in his possession the papers which
prove the birth, existence, and rights of Talbot's heiress! It would
make you as poor as my ancestor Job, Don Fabiano, and would leave you
no better castles than your castles in Spain, which would be very
hard for you.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Yes! But no one has those papers.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Yes. Some one has them.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>You, miserable wretch! It isn't true! Jew speaks, Jew lies.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>I have got the papers.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>You lie! Where have you got them?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>In my pocket.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>I don't believe you. Are they all in order? Nothing lacking?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Nothing is lacking.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Then I must have them.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Gently.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Jew, give me those papers!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Excellent! Jew, miserable beggar who crawls through the streets, give
me the city of Shrewsbury, give me the city of Wexford, give me the
earldom of Waterford! Charity, if you please!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Those papers are everything to me and nothing to you.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Simon Renard and Lord Chandos would pay me pretty high for them.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Simon Renard and Lord Chandos are two dogs between whom I will have
you hanged.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>You have nothing else to say to me? Then farewell.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Come back! What do you want me to give you for those papers?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Something which you have with you.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>My purse?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>Out upon you! Do you want mine?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>There is a parchment which never leaves you. It is a signature in
blank which the Queen gave you, and in which she swears, upon her
Catholic crown, to grant any favor he may ask, to the one who
presents it. Give me that signature in blank, and you shall have Jane
Talbot's titles. Paper for paper.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>What do you want to do with this signature in blank?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>I will explain. Cards on the table, my lord. I have told you your
affairs; now I will tell you mine. I am one of the principal
money-dealers in Kantersten Street, Brussels. I lend money; it is my
business. I lend ten and get back fifteen. I lend to every one: I
would lend to the devil; I would lend to the Pope. Two months ago one
of my creditors died, without paying me. It was an old exiled servant
of the Talbot family. The poor man left nothing but a few rags: I
seized them. Among these rags I found a box, and in the box some
papers&#8212;Jane Talbot's papers, my lord, giving her entire history in
detail and furnishing proofs for better times. The Queen of England
had just given you Jane Talbot's estates. I was in great need of the
Queen of England at that time, for I wanted to make a loan of ten
thousand gold marks. I realized that I might do business with you. I
came to England in this disguise; I made myself a spy upon you, upon
Jane Talbot. I did it all myself. In this way I learned everything,
and here I am. You shall have Jane Talbot's papers if you give me the
Queen's signature in blank. I will write upon it that the Queen shall
give me ten thousand gold marks. They owe me something at the
excise-office, but I won't haggle. Ten thousand gold marks&#8212;nothing
more. I don't ask you for the sum, because only a crowned head could
pay it. I am speaking frankly, you see. Two men as clever as we are,
my lord, have nothing to gain by deceiving each other. If frankness
were banished from the earth, it would be re-discovered in a
<i>tête-à-tête</i> between two rogues.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Impossible! I can't give you this signature in blank. Ten thousand
gold marks! What would the Queen say? And then, to-morrow I may be
disgraced: this signature in blank is my safeguard. This signature in
blank is my head.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>What does that matter to me?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Ask me for something else.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>I want that.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Jew, give me Jane Talbot's papers.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p>My lord, give me the Queen's signature in blank.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Accursed Jew, I will have to yield. [<i>Draws a paper from his pocket.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">THE MAN.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>They go close to the lantern. <span class="sc">Fabiani</span> stands behind the Jew, and

<p>"We, Mary, Queen&#8212;" It is well. You see, my lord, I am like you. I

<p>Faith! I believe he is dead. Quick, the papers. [<i>He searches the

him! Not a paper! He was lying, the old wretch! He deceived me: he
wanted to rob me. Is it possible, you accursed Jew! No, he has
nothing. That is clear. I have killed him for nothing. They are all
alike, these Jews. To lie and steal, that is all they can do. Come,
let us get rid of this corpse; I can't leave it here at the door.

help me throw it into the Thames.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He descends, and disappears behind the parapet.</i></p>

<p class="scene sc">Gilbert, Fabiani</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI (<i>returning</i>).</p>

<p>Who goes there?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>A man has been assassinated.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>No, a Jew.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Who killed him?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Faith! You or I.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Sir?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>No witnesses. A corpse on the ground. Two men beside it. Which is the
assassin? There is nothing to prove it is one rather than the
other&#8212;I rather than you.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Miserable man! You are the assassin!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Well, yes! To be frank, I am. What of it?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I am going to call the constables.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>You are going to help me throw the body into the water.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I will have you seized and punished.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>You will help me throw the body into the water.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You are insolent.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Do as I say! Let us destroy all traces of this. Believe me, you are
more interested in the matter than I am.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Upon my soul!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>One of us two did the deed. I am a great lord, a nobleman. You are a
passer-by, a peasant, a man of the people. A noble who kills a Jew
pays a fine of four sous; a man of the people who kills one of his
fellow-creatures is hanged.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You would dare&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>If you denounce me, I will denounce you. I will be believed sooner
than you. At any rate, the chances are unequal. Four sous fine for
me, and the gallows for you.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>No witnesses! No proofs! Oh, my brain is bewildered! This miserable
man is right, he has me in his power.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Shall I help you throw the corpse into the river?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You are a demon!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> takes the body up by the head, <span class="sc">Fabiani</span> by the feet;
they carry it to the parapet.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Yes. Faith, my friend, I can no longer exactly tell which of us
killed this man!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>They go down behind the parapet. <span class="sc">Fabiani</span> re-appears.</i></p>

<p>It is done. Good-night, comrade! Go your way!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He starts toward the house, but turns back, seeing that <span class="sc">Gilbert</span>

<p>Well, what do you want? Money for your trouble? In truth, I don't owe
you anything, but here, take this.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He gives his purse to <span class="sc">Gilbert</span>, whose first impulse is to refuse
it, but who accepts it afterward with the air of a man who has
reflected.</i></p>

<p>Well, go! What more are you waiting for?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Then stay, if it pleases you. You can have the fine starlight while I
have the pretty girl. God be with you!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He starts toward the door of the house and is about to open it.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Where are you going?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Faith, into my house!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>How? Into your house!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>That is what I said.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Which of us two is dreaming? A short time ago you told me that I was
the Jew's assassin! Now you tell me that that house is yours.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Or that of my mistress, which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Repeat what you have just said.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>My friend, I say, since you wish to know, that this house belongs to
a beautiful girl named Jane, who is my mistress.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>And I tell you, my lord, that you lie! I tell you that you are a liar
and an assassin! I tell you that you are an insolent knave! I tell
you, you have pronounced some fatal words which will kill us
both&#8212;you, for having said them: me, for having heard them.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Dear me! Who the devil is this man?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I am Gilbert the engraver. Jane is my betrothed.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>And I am the Chevalier Amyas Pawlet. Jane is my mistress.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You lie, I tell you! You are Lord Clanbrassil, the Queen's favorite.
Don't you think I know that, fool!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p>Everybody seems to know me to-night. Another dangerous man, whom we
must get rid of.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Tell me instantly that you have lied like a coward, and that Jane is
not your mistress!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Do you know her writing?</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He takes a note from his pocket.</i></p>

<p>Read this!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>Aside, while <span class="sc">Gilbert</span> tremblingly unfolds the paper.</i></p>

<p>If he would go in and quarrel with Jane, it would give my people time
to get here.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT (<i>reading</i>).</p>

<p>"I will be alone to-night. You can come." Malediction! My lord, you
have dishonored my betrothed, you are an infamous wretch! I demand my
revenge.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI (<i>putting his hand to his sword</i>).</p>

<p>Willingly! Where is your sword?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Oh, fury! To be one of the people! To have nothing&#8212;neither sword nor
dagger. Well, you can go; but I will wait for you at night, in a
corner of the street, and I will stick my nails into your throat, and
I will assassinate you, you villain!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Dear me! How violent you are, my friend.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I will be revenged upon you, my lord!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>You! Revenged upon me? You so low, upon me so high! You are crazy!
I defy you.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You defy me?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You shall see.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p>To-morrow's sun must not rise for this man. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Friend, listen
to me. Go into your house. I am sorry you found it out, but I leave
the beauty to you. Go in.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He throws a key down at <span class="sc">Gilbert's</span> feet.</i></p>

<p>There is a key, if you haven't got one. Or, if you like it better,
you can knock against the shutter three times and Jane will think it
is I, and let you in. Good-night. [<i>He goes off.</i></p>


<h4>SCENE VIII</h4>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT (<i>alone</i>).</p>

<p>He is gone. He is no longer here. I did not grind and crush him

<p class="staging">[<i>He sees on the ground the dagger with which <span class="sc">Lord Clanbrassil</span>

<p>Ah, you come too late; you can probably kill no one but myself. All
the same, whether you fall from heaven or are vomited up from hell, I
bless you. My Jane has betrayed me! Jane has given herself to this
infamous man. Jane is the heiress of Lord Talbot. Jane is lost to me!
O God! more terrible things have come to me in this hour than my
brain can stand.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i><span class="sc">Simon Renard</span> appears in the darkness at the back.</i></p>

<p>Oh, to be revenged on that man! To be revenged on this Lord
Clanbrassil! If I go to the Queen's palace, the lackeys will kick me
out as if I were a dog. I am mad! My head will burst! I am willing to
die, but I want to be revenged. I would give my blood for revenge!
Will nobody in the world make this bargain with me? Who will give me
vengeance on Lord Clanbrassil and take my life in payment?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>I can't help it, my lord; you know that. He is here as the ambassador

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Your future husband!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Come, my lord, let us not speak of that. I love you! What more do you

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>One moment more, Mary!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>It is time for the secret council to meet. Until now, there has been

have a young and beautiful head!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>It is you who are beautiful, madame. You need only your beauty to be
all-powerful. There is something on your head which tells me you are
the Queen; but it is written plainer on your brow than on your crown!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Flatterer!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>I love you!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You love me, do you not? You love only me? Say it to me again, just
like that, with the same eyes! Alas! we poor women, we never know
just what is passing in a man's heart. We have to trust your eyes;
and the handsomest eyes, Fabiani, are often the most false. But
yours, my lord, are so full of loyalty, so full of candor, so full of
good faith, they could not deceive, those eyes&#8212;could they? Yes, my
beautiful page, your glances are artless and sincere. Oh, it would be
shameful to take such heavenly eyes to betray with! Your eyes are the
eyes either of a devil or an angel!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Neither angel nor devil. A man who loves you!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Who loves the Queen?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Who loves Mary.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Listen to me, Fabiani. I love you, too. You are young; there are many
beautiful women who smile tenderly on you&#8212;I know it. People get
tired of queens as well as of other women.&#8212;Don't interrupt me!&#8212;If
you ever fall in love with another woman, I want you to tell me about
it.&#8212;Don't interrupt me, dear!&#8212;I may forgive you, if you tell me
about it. You don't know how much I love you. I don't know myself. It
is true, there are moments when I would rather see you dead than
happy with another; but there are also moments when I would rather
have you happy. Indeed, I don't know why they try to make me out such
a wicked woman!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>I can only be happy with you, Mary! I love no one but you!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Are you sure? Look at me! Are you sure? Oh, I am jealous sometimes! I
imagine&#8212;where is the woman who does not think of these
things?&#8212;sometimes I imagine that you are false to me. I would like
to be invisible, so that I might follow you, and always know what you
are doing, what you are saying, where you are! In fairy stories they
tell about a ring which makes one invisible; I would give my crown to
have such a ring as that. I keep thinking that you go to see the
beautiful women in the city. Oh, you must not deceive me&#8212;indeed, you
must not!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Banish such thoughts from your mind, madame. I false to you, my love,
my queen, my kind mistress! To do that, I would have to be the most
thankless, the most miserable of men. And I have given you no reason
to think me the most thankless, the most miserable of men. I love
you, Mary; I adore you! I could not even look at another woman! I
love you, I say; but don't you see it in my eyes? There must be some
way to persuade you! Look at me well! Do I look like a man who is
false? When a man deceives a woman, you can see it at once. Women are
seldom mistaken about that. And what a time you choose to tell me
these things&#8212;the one moment in my life when I love you the most! It
is true, I am sure I never loved you so much as I do to-day. I am not
speaking to the Queen. What do I care about the Queen? What can she
do to me? She can have my head cut off; what does that amount to?
You, Mary, can break my heart. It isn't your sovereignty that I love,
it is yourself. It is your beautiful white and soft hand that I love
to kiss; it isn't your scepter, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Thank you, my Fabiano. Good-by! Ah, my lord, how young you are! What
beautiful black hair, what a graceful head you have! Come back to me

<p>Isn't this a sufficient crime for his execution, sir?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p class="scene sc">The Queen, Gilbert, Simon Renard</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Before whom do I stand?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Before the Queen.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>The Queen!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Yes, the Queen. I am the Queen. There is no time for astonishment.
You, sir, are Gilbert, a workman, an engraver. You live somewhere
beyond the borders of the river, with a woman named Jane, who is your
betrothed, and who deceives you, whose lover is a man named Fabiano,
who deceives me. You want revenge, so do I. In order to get it, I
must be able to make any disposition I please of your life. It is
necessary that you should say what I command you to say, no matter
what it is. For you, there must be no longer either false or true,
good or bad, justice or injustice&#8212;nothing but my vengeance and my
will. I shall require you to let me act, and to let yourself be acted
upon. Do you consent?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Madame&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You shall have your revenge; but I warn you, it will cost you your
life&#8212;that is all. Make your conditions. If you have an old mother
and you want her tablecloth covered with ingots of gold, speak, I
will do it. Sell me your life as dear as you please.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I am no longer willing to die, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about it all night. Nothing is proved yet. I saw
a man who boasted that he was Jane's lover. How do I know that he did
not lie? I saw a key! How do I know that he did not steal it? I saw a
letter! How do I know that she was not forced to write it? I don't
even know whether it was her writing; it was dark, I was excited, I
could not see. I can't give up my life, which is her life, like that.
I don't believe any of it, I am not sure of any of it, I have not
seen Jane!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that you love. You are like me, you refuse all the
proofs. But if you see her, your Jane, if you hear her confess the
crime, will you do what I wish?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Yes, upon one condition.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Tell it to me afterward. [<i>To <span class="sc">Simon Renard</span>.</i>] Bring this woman here
at once.</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="scene"><i><span class="sc">The Queen; Jane; Gilbert</span> behind the curtain</i></p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Approach, young woman. You know who we are?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Yes, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You know who is the man who seduced you?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Yes, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>He deceived you. He passed himself off for a nobleman called Amyas
Pawlet?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Yes, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You know now that it is Fabiano Fabiani, Earl of Clanbrassil?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Yes, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Last night, when they seized you in your house, you had given him a
rendezvous, you were waiting for him?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>wringing her hands</i>).</p>

<p>Heavens, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Answer!</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>with feeble voice</i>).</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You understand that there is no more hope, neither for him nor for
you?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Nothing but death! That is a hope!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Tell me all about it. Where did you meet this man first?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>The first time I saw him was&#8212; But what is the use? A poor wretched
girl of the people, frivolous and vain, in love with jewels and fine
clothes, a girl dazzled with the handsome looks of a great lord&#8212;that
is all. I am seduced, I am dishonored, I am lost. There is nothing to
add to that. My God, madame, don't you see that each word I speak is
killing me?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Enough.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Your anger is terrible, I know it, madame. My head bends now beneath
the punishment you have prepared for me.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Punishment for you? Do you think I concern myself about you,
simpleton? Who are you, wretched creature, that the Queen should
concern herself about you? Oh, no! Fabiano is my affair. As for you,
madame, some one else will look out for your punishment.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Well, madame, whoever that one may be, whatever the punishment, I
will endure all without a murmur. I will even thank you if you will
listen to one prayer I am about to make. There is a man who took me
in, an orphan from my birth, who adopted me, brought me up, nourished
me, loved me, and who loves me still; a man of whom I am most
unworthy, toward whom I have been most guilty, and yet whose image
lies at the bottom of my heart, beloved, revered, sacred as is that
of God; a man who now, while I am speaking to you, finds his home
empty, deserted, robbed, who can't understand it, and who rends his
garments in anguish. Well, madame, what I ask of your Majesty is that
he may never understand, that I may disappear without his knowing
what has become of me, what I have done, or what you have done with
me. Alas, kind Heaven, I do not know how to make you understand, but
you ought to feel that I have a friend in him&#8212;a noble, generous
friend. Poor Gilbert! yes, it is true, he respects me and believes me
pure, and I do not want him to hate me and despise me! Oh, you
understand me, don't you, madame? That man's respect is a great deal
more to me than my life. And then it will make him suffer so
much&#8212;such a surprise! He won't believe it at first. No, he will not
believe it. My God! Poor Gilbert. Oh, madame, have pity on him and on
me! He has done you no harm! In the name of Heaven, keep him from
knowing the awful truth! In the name of Heaven, don't let him know
that I am guilty. He will kill himself. Don't let him know that I am
dead. He will die too.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>The man you are speaking of is here; he is listening to you; he will
judge you, he will punish you! [<i><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> appears.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Heavens! Gilbert!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT (<i>to the <span class="sc">Queen</span></i>).</p>

<p>My life belongs to you, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Good. Have you any conditions to make?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Yes, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What are they? We give you our royal word that we will grant them.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>This, madame. It is very simple. It is a debt of gratitude I pay to
one of your noble lords, who employed me a great deal in my capacity
as engraver.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Speak!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>This lord has a secret liaison with a woman whom he cannot marry
because she belongs to a proscribed family. This woman, who up to the
present time has lived in concealment, is the only daughter and
heiress of the last Lord Talbot, beheaded under King Henry VIII.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What? Are you sure of what you are saying? You say, John Talbot, the
good Catholic lord, the loyal defender of my mother of Aragon, has
left a daughter? Upon my crown, if that is true, this child is my
daughter. And what John Talbot did for the mother of Mary of England,
Mary of England will do for the daughter of John Talbot.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Then, of course, it will be a pleasure to your Majesty to give back
Lord Talbot's estates to his daughter?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Yes, truly, and to take them away from Fabiano. But are there proofs
that this heiress exists?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>There are!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>And if there are not, we will make them! We are not a queen for
nothing!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Your Majesty will give back to Lord Talbot's daughter the estates,
lands, rank, coat-of-arms, and device of her father. Your Majesty
will remove her from all proscription, and will guarantee that her
life shall be safe. Your Majesty will marry her to this lord, who is
the only man she can marry. Upon these conditions, madame, you can
dispose of me, of my liberty, of my life, and of my will as you see
fit.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Good! I will do what you have asked.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Your Majesty will do what I have asked? The Queen of England swears
it to me, Gilbert the engraver, upon her crown which is here, and
upon the open gospel which is there?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Upon the royal crown which is here, and the divine gospel which is
there, I swear it.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>The compact is concluded, madame. Have a tomb prepared for me and a
nuptial bed prepared for the lovers. The lord I speak of is Fabiani,
Earl of Clanbrassil. Talbot's heiress, behold her!</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>What does he say?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Am I dealing with a fool? What do you mean? Have a care, sir! You are
bold to mock the Queen of England! In the royal chambers people
should look to their words; there are times when the lips bring the
head to the block!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You have my head, madame; I have your oath.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You do not mean to say you are speaking seriously? This Fabiano&#8212;this
Jane! Come, come!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>This Jane is the daughter and the heiress of Lord Talbot.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Bah! Nonsense! Delusion! Fancy! Have you got the proofs?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Complete!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He takes a packet from his breast.</i></p>

<p>Read these papers.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Have I time to read your papers? Did I ask for your papers? What do
your papers matter to me? If they prove anything, upon my soul, I
will throw them into the fire and nothing will be left of them.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Nothing but your oath, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>My oath, my oath!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Upon the crown and upon the gospel, madame; that is to say, on your
head and your soul&#8212;on your life in this world, and on your life in
the next.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>But what do you want? Oh, I swear you are mad!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>What do I want? Jane has lost her rank, give it back to her! Jane has
lost her honor, give it back to her! Proclaim her the daughter of
Lord Talbot and the wife of Lord Clanbrassil, and then take my life.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Your life! What do you want me to do with your life then? I didn't
want it except to use for vengeance on this man&#8212;this Fabiano. You
can't understand anything at all, can you? Well! I can't understand
you, either. You talked about vengeance! That is the way you avenge
yourself, is it? These men of the people are stupid! And after all,
do you suppose I believe your ridiculous story about an heiress of
Talbot? The papers! You show me papers! I won't look at them. Oh, a
woman wrongs you, and you play the magnanimous. Well, do it if it
suits you! I am not magnanimous! No! My heart is full of rage and
hate. I will avenge myself and you shall help me! Oh, but this man is
mad, mad, mad! My God! why do I need him? It is exasperating to have
to deal with people like this, at such a serious time.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I have your word, as Catholic Queen. Lord Clanbrassil has seduced
Jane; he shall marry her!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>And if he refuses to marry her?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You will force him to do it.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Oh, no! Have pity upon me, Gilbert!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Well, then, if this infamous wretch refuses, your Majesty can do what
she pleases with him and with me!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN (<i>with joy</i>).</p>

<p>Ah, that is all I ask!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>In that case, I will do everything the Queen commands, provided the
crown of the Countess of Waterford is solemnly replaced by the Queen
on the sacred and inviolable head of Jane, who stands here!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Everything?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Everything! Even a crime, if it is a crime you want. I will not stop
at treachery, which is more than a crime; nor at infamy, which is
more than treachery.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You will say what I want you to say? You will die the death that I
want you to die?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I swear it!</p>

reproach you! To keep me away, to exile me so long! Ah, it wouldn't
be thus if you thought of me during these hours of absence as I think
of you!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You are unjust. Since you left me, I have thought of no one but you!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Is that really true? Does so much happiness belong to me? Say it to
me again!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN (<i>always smiling</i>).</p>

<p>I swear it to you!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Then you do indeed love me as I love you?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Yes, my lord! Truly, I have thought of no one but you. So much so,
that I have tried to plan a pleasant surprise for your return.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>What do you mean? What surprise?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>A meeting which will give you pleasure!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>A meeting with whom?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Guess! Can't you guess?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>No, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Turn around!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He turns and sees <span class="sc">Jane</span> on the threshold of the little door, which

<p class="speaker">FABIANI (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p>Jane!</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p>It is he!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN (<i>with the same smile</i>).</p>

<p>My lord, do you know this young woman?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>No, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Young woman, do you know this lord?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Truth before life! Yes, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>So, my lord, you do not know this woman?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Madame, this is a conspiracy. I am surrounded by enemies. This woman
is doubtless in league with them. I do not know her, madame! I do not
even know who she is, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN (<i>rising and striking him in the face with her glove</i>).</p>

<p>Ah, you are a coward! You betray one and disown the other! You don't
even know who she is? Do you want me to tell you? This woman is Jane
Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, the good Catholic lord who perished
on the scaffold for my mother. This woman is Jane Talbot, my cousin:
Jane Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury, Countess of Wexford, Countess of
Waterford, peeress of England. That is who she is, this woman! Lord
Paget, you are commissioner of the private seal; you will remember
our words. The Queen of England solemnly recognizes this woman here
present, as Jane, daughter and sole heiress of the last Earl of
Waterford. [<i>Showing the papers.</i>] Here are the titles and the
proofs, which you will have sealed with the great seal. It is our
will.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>To <span class="sc">Fabiani</span></i>] Yes, Countess of Waterford, and it is proved! And
you will give back her estates, you wretched man! Ah, you don't know
this woman? You don't know who she is? Well, I am telling you! It is
Jane Talbot. Shall I tell you more yet?</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>Looking him in the face, in a low voice, between her teeth.</i></p>

<p>Coward, she is your mistress!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>That is what she is! Now, this is what you are! You are a man without
soul, a man without heart, a man without brains. You are a liar and a
villain! You are&#8212;By my faith, gentlemen, you need not draw away. I
am quite willing you should hear what I have to say to this man. I am
not lowering my voice, it seems to me. Fabiano, you are a wretch; a
traitor to me, a coward to her; a lying lackey, the most vile, the
lowest of all men. Yet it is true, I made you Earl of Clanbrassil,
Baron of Dinasmonddy and what more? Baron of Darmouth in Devonshire.
Ah, well! I was an idiot! My lords, I ask your pardon for having
forced you to be elbowed by that man there. You, a knight! you, a
noble! you, a lord! Compare yourself a little with those who are
such. Look! look around you! There stand noblemen. There is Bridges,
Baron Chandos; there is Seymour, Duke of Somerset. There are the
Stanleys, who have been Earls of Derby since 1485. There are the
Clintons, who have been barons since 1298. Do you imagine you are
like these people&#8212;you? You say that you are allied to the Spanish
family of Peñalver, but it is not true; you are only a bad Italian.
Nothing&#8212;worse than nothing! Son of a shoemaker in the village of
Larino! Yes, gentlemen, the son of a shoemaker! I knew it, and I did
not tell it; I concealed it, and I made believe I credited this man
when he talked about his nobility. That is the way we are, we women.
Oh, Heaven! I wish there were women here; it would be a lesson to
them all. This scoundrel! this scoundrel! he betrays one woman and
disowns the other. Infamous creature! Oh, yes, indeed you are
infamous. What! I have been speaking all this time and he is not yet
on his knees? On your knees, Fabiani! My lords, force this man to
kneel!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Your Majesty&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>This creature whom I have loaded with benefits! this Neapolitan
lackey whom I have made a noble knight and a proud earl of England.
Ah, I ought to have expected this! But I am always like that; I am
obstinate, and afterward I see that I am wrong. It is my fault.
Italian stands for liar: Neapolitan for coward. Every time that my
father made use of an Italian, he repented of it. This Fabiani! You
see Lady Jane, unfortunate child, to what a man you have surrendered
yourself! But I will avenge you. Oh, I ought to have known it from
the first. You will find nothing in an Italian's pocket but a
stiletto, nothing in his soul but treachery.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Madame, I swear to you&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Good! Now he will perjure himself; he will descend to the depths of
infamy; he will make us blush to our finger-tips before these men&#8212;we
women who have loved him. He will not even lift up his head!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Yes, madame, I will lift it up! I am lost; I see it clearly. My death
is decided. You will make use of every means, dagger, poison&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN (<i>taking hold of both his hands and dragging him violently
to the front of the stage</i>).</p>

<p>Poison! Dagger! What are you saying, Italian? A treacherous
vengeance, a disgraceful vengeance&#8212;a vengeance from the back, a
vengeance such as you take in your country? No, Signor Fabiani,
neither dagger nor poison. Do I have to conceal myself? Do I have to
hide in the corners of the street at night and make myself small when
I want revenge? No, by my faith, I want the daylight! Do you hear, my
lord?&#8212;the full noonday, the bright sun, the public square, the ax
and the stake, the crowds in the street, the crowds at the windows,
the crowds on the roofs! A hundred thousand witnesses! I want people
to be afraid, do you hear, my lord? I want them to think it splendid,
frightful, magnificent. I want them to say, "It is a woman who has
been wronged, but it is a Queen who takes revenge!" This much envied
favorite, this handsome, insolent young man, whom I have dressed in
velvets and satins, I want to see him bent double, terrified and
trembling, on his knees before a black cloth, with naked feet, with
manacled wrists, hissed by the people, fingered by the executioner.
On this white neck, where I have put a golden collar, I want to put a
rope. I have seen how Fabiani looks upon a throne, I want to see how
he looks upon a scaffold.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Madame&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Not a word! Not a word! You are indeed lost, as you say. You will
mount the scaffold as did Suffolk and Northumberland. This will be a
festival such as I have given before to my good city of London. You
know how she hates you, this good city of mine! Faith, when one wants
vengeance, it's a good thing to be Mary, Queen of England, daughter
of Henry VIII. and mistress of four seas. When you are on the
scaffold, you can make a long speech to the people, if you like, as
Northumberland did, or a long prayer to God, as Suffolk did, in order
to give pardon the time to arrive; but God is my witness that you are
a traitor, and the pardon will not come. This wretched liar who
talked of love to me, and this morning even said "thou" to me&#8212;Eh,
gentlemen, it seems to amaze you that I talk thus openly before you;
but I repeat it, what do I care?</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>To <span class="sc">Lord Somerset</span>.</i>] My lord duke, you are constable of the Tower;
demand this man's sword!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Here it is; but I protest. Admitting that it is proved that I
deceived or seduced a woman&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What does it matter to me whether you have seduced a woman? Do I
concern myself about that? These gentlemen are witnesses, it is a
matter of indifference to me!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>The seduction of a woman is not a capital offense, madame. Your
Majesty could not procure Frogmorton's condemnation upon the same
accusation!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>I believe he defies us now! The worm has become a serpent. Who says
you are accused of that?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Of what else am I accused? I am not an Englishman; I am no subject of
your Majesty. I am a subject of the King of Naples and a vassal of
the Holy Father. I will appeal to his embassador, the eminent
Cardinal Polus, to save me. I will defend myself, madame. I am a
stranger! I cannot be tried unless I have committed a crime&#8212;a real
crime. What is my crime?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You ask what your crime is?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Yes, madame.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You all hear this question that he has asked, my lords? You shall
hear the answer. Listen, and look out for yourselves, all of you,
however great you may be, because you will see that I need only stamp
upon the earth with my foot to bring from out of it a scaffold.
Chandos, open that folding-door. Call the Court&#8212;every one! Bid every
one enter.</p>

<h4>SCENE VIII</h4>

<p class="scene"><i>The same. The <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>, all the Court</i></p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Enter, enter, my lords! I am truly pleased to see you to-day. Good!
good! The officers of the law this way: nearer, nearer! Where are the
sergeants-at-arms of the House of Lords? Harriot and Herbert? Ah,
there you are, gentlemen! Be welcome! Draw your swords. Good! Place
yourselves at the right and at the left of that man. He is your
prisoner.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Madame, what is my crime?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>My Lord Gardiner, my learned friend, you are chancellor of England.
We order you and the twelve lord commissioners of the Star Chamber,
whom we regret not to see here, to assemble yourselves in haste.
Strange things are passing in this palace. Listen, my lords! Madame
Elizabeth has raised more than one enemy to our crown. We have had
the Pietro Caro plot&#8212;that man who started the Exeter movement, and
who communicated with Madame Elizabeth by means of a cipher cut on
her guitar. We have had the treachery of Thomas Wyatt who roused the
county of Kent. We have had the rebellion of the Duke of Suffolk, who
was captured in the hollow of a tree, after his followers were
defeated. To-day we have a new attempt. Listen, all of you. To-day,
this morning, a man presented himself at my audience. After a few
words, he drew his dagger on me. I stopped his hand in time. Lord
Chandos and the bailiff D'Amont seized the man. He says that he was
urged to the crime by Lord Clanbrassil.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>By me! It is not true! This is a frightful thing! This man does not
exist. This man cannot be found! Who is he? Where is he?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>He is here!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT (<i>coming out from among the soldiers, behind whom he has been
hidden up to this time</i>).</p>

<p>I am the man!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>According to this man's declarations, we Mary, Queen, accuse before
the Star Chamber this other man, Fabiano Fabiani, Earl of
Clanbrassil, of high treason, and of an attempt of regicide upon our
imperial and sacred person.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Regicide? I? This is monstrous. Oh, my brain is bewildered! I cannot
see clear! What is this trap? Whoever you may be, wretched creature,
dare you affirm that what the Queen says is true?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>I urged you to regicide?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Yes, always yes! Malediction! Oh, it is impossible for you to know
how false that is, gentlemen. That man comes from hell! Unfortunate
wretch, you want to ruin me, but don't you see that you ruin yourself
in the same breath? The crime you charge upon me falls upon you too.
You will send me to the block, but you will die also. Madman, with a
single word you cause two heads to fall! Did you know that?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I know it.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>My lords, this man is bribed&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>By you. Here is the purse full of gold which you paid me for the
crime. Your crest and your monogram are embroidered upon it.</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Just Heaven! But you don't show me the dagger with which this man, it
is said, attempted to strike the Queen. Where is the dagger?</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CHANDOS.</p>

<p>Here it is!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT (<i>to <span class="sc">Fabiani</span></i>).</p>

<p>It is yours. You gave it to me for that purpose. They will find the
sheath at your house!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE LORD CHANCELLOR.</p>

<p>Earl of Clanbrassil, what reply do you make? Do you recognize this
man?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>In truth, he only saw me by night. Let me whisper two words to him,
madame, they will help his memory. [<i>He approaches <span class="sc">Fabiani</span>.</i>] My
lord, you appear to recognize no one to-day&#8212;neither the man you have
wronged, nor the woman you have seduced. Ah, the Queen avenges
herself; but the man of the people, he avenges himself also. You
defied me to do it, I think. Behold yourself caught between a double
vengeance, my lord! What do you say to that? I am Gilbert the
engraver!</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Yes, I recognize you. My lords, I recognize this man. Since it is
with him I have to deal, I have nothing more to say.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>He confesses!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE LORD CHANCELLOR (<i>to <span class="sc">Gilbert</span></i>).</p>

<p>According to Norman law and Statute 25, Henry VIII., in a case of
high treason of the first degree, a confession does not save the
accomplice. Do not forget, it is a case wherein the Queen has not the
right of mercy, and you will die upon the scaffold as well as the man
you accuse. Therefore reflect! Do you confirm all you have said?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I know that I shall die, and I confirm it.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p>My God! if this is a dream, it is very horrible.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE LORD CHANCELLOR (<i>to <span class="sc">Gilbert</span></i>).</p>

<p>Are you willing to repeat your statements with your hand upon the
gospel?</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>He presents the gospel to <span class="sc">Gilbert</span>, who puts his hand upon it.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>With my hand upon the gospel, and my approaching death before my
eyes, I swear that this man is an assassin; that this dagger, which
is his, was used for the crime; that this purse, which is his, was
given to me in payment for the crime. May God help me! It is the
truth!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE LORD CHANCELLOR (<i>to <span class="sc">Fabiani</span></i>).</p>

<p>My lord, what have you to say?</p>

<p class="speaker">FABIANI.</p>

<p>Nothing! I am lost.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD (<i>low to <span class="sc">The Queen</span></i>).</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>My lord Duke of Somerset, these two men to the Tower! My Lord
Gardiner, our chancellor, let their trial before the twelve peers of
the Star Chamber commence to-morrow, and may God keep watch over
England. We expect them to be judged, both of them, before we leave
for Exford, where we are to open Parliament, and for Windsor, where
we are to spend Easter.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>To the <span class="sc">Executioner</span>.</i>] Approach! I am glad to see you! You are a
faithful servant. You are old; you have already witnessed three
reigns. It is customary for the sovereigns of this kingdom to make
you as costly a gift as possible, upon their ascension. My father,
Henry VIII., gave you the diamond clasp of his cloak. My brother,
Edward VI., gave you a goblet of chased gold. It is my turn now; I
have not given you anything yet. I must give you a present. Come
nearer! [<i>Indicating <span class="sc">Fabiani</span>.</i>] Do you see that head&#8212;that young,
adorable head; that head, which, up to this morning, was the dearest,

<p>Alas!</p>

<p>No more hope?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>No more hope. [<i><span class="sc">Gilbert</span> goes to the window.</i></p>

<p>You won't see anything from the window.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>You inquired, didn't you?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>I am only too sure.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>It is for Fabiani?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>It is for Fabiani.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>How fortunate that man is! Maledictions on me!</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Poor Gilbert! Your turn will come! To-day, it is he; to-morrow it
will be you!</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>What do you say? We are not thinking of the same thing. What are you
talking about?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>About the scaffold which they are building.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>And I&#8212;I am speaking of Jane!</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Of Jane?</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Yes, of Jane! Only of Jane. What does the rest matter to me? You have
forgotten, have you? You don't remember that for one whole month,
glued to the bars of my cell, from which I can look into the street,
I have watched her, pale and sad, wandering around the base of this
tower, which holds two men, Fabiani and me. You have forgotten all
about my anguish, have you, and my doubts, my misgivings? For which
of us does she come? Poor wretch, I ask myself this question day and
night. I asked you, Joshua; and last night you promised to try to see
her, and speak to her. Oh, tell me! Did you learn anything! Is it for
me she comes, or is it for Fabiani?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>I learned that Fabiani is certainly to be beheaded to-day, and you
to-morrow, and from that moment I confess I lost my head, Gilbert.
The scaffold drove Jane entirely out of my thoughts. Your death&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>My death! What do you mean by that word! My death is that Jane loves
me no longer. From the day that I was no longer beloved, I was dead.
Oh, yes! truly dead. Joshua, what has remained of me since that time
won't be worth taking to-morrow. Oh, Joshua, you don't know, you
can't understand what a man is when he loves. If any one had said to
me, two months ago, "Jane, your Jane without reproach, your Jane so
pure, your love, your pride, your lily, your treasure, Jane will give
herself to another; will you take her then?" I should have said, "No,
I will not have her! rather death a thousand times for her and for
myself." And I should have crushed under my feet any one who had
dared to speak to me like that. If I would take her?&#8212;To-day, you
know, Jane is no longer the Jane without stain, whom I adored, the
Jane whose brow I hardly dared touch with my lips. Jane has given
herself to another&#8212;to a wretch! I know it&#8212;and&#8212;well, it's all the
same to me. I love her! My heart is broken, but I love her! I would
kiss the hem of her dress, and I would ask her pardon, if she would
only take me. She might be in the gutter with those who belong there,
and I would take her out, and I would hold her close to my heart,
Joshua! Joshua, I would give, not a hundred years of life, since I no
longer possess one day, but the eternity which will be mine
to-morrow, just to see her smile at me once more&#8212;just once more
before my death&#8212;and to have her say to me those dear words she used
to say, "I love you." Joshua, Joshua, that is the way a man's heart
is, when he loves. You think you would kill the woman who betrays
you? No, you wouldn't kill her; you would lie at her feet afterward,
the same as before, only you would be sad. You think I am weak? What
should I have gained in killing Jane? Oh, my heart will burst with
all these unbearable thoughts! If she only loved me now, what would
it matter to me, what she has done? But she loves Fabiani! But she
loves Fabiani! It is for Fabiani that she comes here! There is one
thing that is sure, it is that I want to die. Have pity on me,
Joshua!</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>Fabiani will die to-day.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>And I to-morrow.</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>God is above all.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>I will be revenged on him to-day. To-morrow, he will be revenged on
me!</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>My brother, here is the second constable of the Tower, Master Eneas
Dulverton. You must go in. I will see you again to-night.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Oh, to die without being beloved! To have no one to weep for us!
Jane! Jane! Jane!</p>

<p>As you say, it is very extraordinary. But what can you expect? The
Queen is crazy. She doesn't know what she wants. You can't count upon
anything. She is a woman. I would like to know what she is here for.

<p>Listen to me, Master Eneas. We are old friends; we must get through
with this thing to-day. Everything here depends upon you. If you are
ordered&#8212;[<i>He whispers to Eneas</i>] be slow about it; let it fall
through skillfully. Let me have two clear hours before me to-night,
and what I want will be accomplished; to-morrow there will be no
favorite. I shall be all-powerful, and you will be baronet and
lieutenant of the Tower the day after. Do you understand?</p>

<p>Ah, the change surprises you? I am no longer myself? Well, what does
that matter to me? It is the truth! I don't want him to die&#8212;now!</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Yet yesterday, your Majesty ordered the execution to take place
to-day.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>As I ordered the day before, that the execution should take place
yesterday. As I ordered Sunday that the execution should take place
Monday. To-day I ordered the execution to take place to-morrow.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, since the second Sunday in Advent, when the
decision was pronounced in the Star Chamber, and the two criminals
came back to the Tower preceded by the executioner with the ax turned
toward them&#8212;and that was three weeks ago&#8212;every day since then your
Majesty has put the matter off until to-morrow.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Well, can't you understand what that means, sir? Must I explain
everything, and must a woman be forced to show her naked heart to
you, because she is a Queen&#8212;unfortunate woman that she is&#8212;and
because you represent the Prince of Spain, her future husband? You
don't understand, you men, that with a woman the heart has its
chastity as well as the body. Well, then, yes&#8212;since you want to
know, since you make believe that you don't understand anything&#8212;yes,
every day I put off Fabiani's execution until to-morrow, because
every morning my courage fails me when I think that the bell of the
Tower of London will ring out his death-knell; because to think they
are sharpening an ax for that man, breaks my heart; because it kills
me to think they will nail a coffin over him; because I am a woman,
because I am weak, because I am insane, because I love him yet, my
God! There! have you got enough? Are you satisfied? Do you understand
now? Oh, some day, my lord, I will have my revenge on you, for all
these things you have made me tell you!</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Yet it ought to be about time to get through with this Fabiani! You
expect to marry my royal master, the Prince of Spain, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>If the Prince of Spain is not satisfied, let him say so; we will
marry somebody else. Suitors are not lacking. The son of the King of
the Romans, the Prince of Piedmont, the Infante of Portugal, Cardinal
Polus, the King of Denmark, and Lord Courtenay are as good noblemen
as he!</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Lord Courtenay! Lord Courtenay!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>An English baron is worth a Spanish prince, my lord. Besides, Lord
Courtenay is descended from the emperors of the East. Oh, get mad if
you like!</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Fabiani has made himself hated by every one in London who has got a
heart.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Peasants and lords are united against him, and if he is not executed
this very day, as your Majesty has promised&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Well!</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>There will be an uprising among the people.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>I've got my lansquenets.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>There will be a conspiracy among the nobles.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>I have the executioner.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Your Majesty swore upon your mother's prayer-book that you would not
pardon him.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Here is a signature in blank which he has sent to me, in which I
swear on my imperial crown that I will pardon him! My father's crown
is worth as much as my mother's prayer-book. One oath destroys the
other. But who says that I will pardon him?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>He has boldly betrayed you, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What does that matter? All men are alike about that. I don't want him
to die. Listen, my lord&#8212;I mean Sir Bailiff. Good God! you confuse my
mind so much that I can't even tell whom I am talking to. Oh, I know
all that you want to say to me! I know he is a vile, degraded,
contemptible man. I know it as well as you, and I blush for it. But I
love him! What do you want me to do about it? I would probably love a
better man less. Moreover, who are you&#8212;all of you&#8212;great as you may
be? Are you any better than he? You will tell me that he is a
favorite, and the English nation detests favorites! Don't I know that
you only want to overthrow him to put the Earl of Kildare&#8212;that fool,
that Irishman&#8212;in his place, that he may have twenty heads a day cut
off? What does that matter to you? Don't talk to me about your Prince
of Spain; you make light enough of him. Don't talk to me about the
anger of M. de Noailles, the French embassador! M. de Noailles is an
idiot, and I will tell him so to his face. As for me, I am a woman; I
want things, and then I don't want them. I am not made all in one
piece. That man's life is necessary to my life. Oh, I beg of you,
don't put on that air of virginal sincerity and good faith. I know
all your intrigues. Between us two, you know as well as I that he
didn't commit the crime for which he is condemned. Well, it is
settled. I don't want Fabiani to die. Am I the mistress, or am I not?
Come, Sir Bailiff, let us talk about something else, will you?</p>

reason enough to be! But I'm not! I love you for loving him! In front
of the scaffold there is no more jealousy&#8212;nothing but love! You are
like me, you forgive him. I understand; men don't understand these
things. Lady Jane, let us have it clearly understood. We are both of
us miserable, are we not? We must save Fabiani! I have no one but
you. I must let you do it! At least, I am sure, you will do it with
all your heart. Take charge of it, gentlemen, both of you. Do

<p>Oh, Gilbert, is that what you ask me, truly? Gilbert, do you deign to
think of what is passing in this poor girl's heart? Gilbert, is it
possible that the love I have for you can interest you, can seem
worth thinking about? Oh, I thought it was quite indifferent to
you&#8212;that you despised me too much to wonder what I did with my
heart. Gilbert, if you only knew how these words you have spoken make
me feel! Oh, it is an unhoped-for gleam of sunshine in my dark night.
Oh, listen to me! If I dared to draw near to you, if I dared to touch
your garments, if I dared to take your hand in mine, if I dared once
more to lift mine eyes to you and to Heaven, as I did once&#8212;do you

go, Jane! I want to live! I want to live! I am beloved.</p>

<p>Not yet. We must have a boat. We must wait until night. But be easy.

laugh, I will sing. Ah, you do love then?</p>

<p>Yes, I love you! yes, I love you! And listen, Gilbert, believe me;
this is the truth as though I were on my death-bed: I have never
loved any one but you. Even in my fall, even in the midst of my sin,
I loved you. Scarcely had I fallen into the arms of that demon who
ruined me, when I wept for my angel.</p>

<p class="speaker">GILBERT.</p>

<p>Forgotten! forgiven! Never speak of it again, Jane! What do I care
for the past? Who could resist your voice, who would do other than I
am doing? Yes, I pardon everything, my well-beloved child. The
foundation of love is mercy and pardon, Jane; jealousy and despair
burned the tears in my eyes, but I pardon you, but I thank you! You
are the only truly bright thing in this world; at each word that you
speak, I feel grief dies, and joy is born in my soul. Jane, lift your
head, stand up straight before me there and look at me! I tell you
that you are my child.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Always generous! Gilbert, my well-beloved.</p>

<p>I wish I were outside now: in our flight, far away: free, with you!
Oh, this night, which will never come! The boat is not there. Jane,
we will leave London at once, this night. We will leave England; we
will go to Venice. Men of my trade make a great deal of money there.
You will belong to me! Oh, my God! I am insane! I have forgotten the

that. I do not lift my eyes so high. I would never take such an
advantage of your pardon. The poor engraver Gilbert shall make no
mesalliance with the Countess of Waterford. No, I will follow you, I
will love you, I will never leave you; I will lie all day at your
feet, all night at your door. I will watch you work, I will help
you, I will give you all you need. I will be to you something less
than a sister, something more than a dog. And if you ever marry,
Gilbert&#8212;because God will want you to find somebody, some pure woman,
without stain and worthy of you&#8212;well, if you marry, and if your wife
is good, if she will let me, I will be your wife's servant. If she
won't have me, I will go off, far off, to die where I can. That is
the only way I shall ever leave you. If you do not marry I will
stay with you, always; I will be gentle and patient&#8212;oh, you shall
see!&#8212;and if people think ill of me because I am with you&#8212;well, they

<p>Death to Fabiani!</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>You must make your decision on the spot, madame. The people demand
this man's death! The Tower is besieged. The revolt is formidable.
Your nobles have been cut to pieces on London Bridge. Your Majesty's
pensioners hold their own yet; but, just the same, your Majesty has
been chased street by street, from the City Hall to the Tower of
London. Madame Elizabeth's followers have joined the people. You can
tell that by the venom of the mob. All this is serious. What does
your Majesty command?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE PEOPLE.</p>

<p>Fabiani! Death to Fabiani!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>They grow louder, and come nearer.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>What does your Majesty command?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>By heaven, my lords! it seems to me you all stand trembling around
me! Upon my soul! must a woman show you your duty as noblemen? To
horse, my lords, to horse! Are you afraid of the rabble? Are swords
afraid of clubs?</p>

<p class="speaker">SIMON RENARD.</p>

<p>Don't let things go any further. Yield, madame, while there is yet
time. You can yet say "the rabble"; in an hour you will have to say
"the people"!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>The cries increase, the noise comes nearer.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You? yes, madame. Fabiano? no!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Very well, I will tell you all then, so much the worse for you.
Fabiano is innocent. Fabiano never committed the crime for which he
was condemned. It was I, and this man here, and the engraver Gilbert.
We did it all; we invented it all; we imagined it all. It was all a
farce! Contradict me if you dare, Sir Bailiff! Now, gentlemen, will
you defend him? He is innocent; I swear it. On my head, on my crown,
on my God, on my mother's soul, he is innocent of the crime. It is as
true as that you stand there, Lord Clinton! Defend him! Annihilate
these wretches as you annihilated Tom Wyatt, my brave Clinton, my old
friend, my good Robert! I swear to you that it is false that Fabiano
tried to assassinate the Queen.</p>

<p class="speaker">LORD CLINTON.</p>

to him.</p>

<h3>THIRD DAY</h3>

<p class="center">PART II</p>


<p><span class="sc">Scene.</span>&#8212;<i>A hall or room into which lead two staircases, one
ascending and the other descending. The entrance to each of these
staircases fills a portion of the back of the stage. The one which
ascends ends at the frieze; the one which descends ends
underneath&#8212;neither the beginning nor the end is visible</i></p>

<p><i>The room is draped with black in a peculiar fashion. The wall on the
right, the wall on the left, and the ceiling are covered with a black
cloth on which is a large white cross; the background, which faces
the spectator, with a white cloth and large black cross. These black
and white draperies continue until they are lost to sight under the
staircases. To the right and to the left, there is an altar draped
with black and white, decorated as if for a funeral. Tall candles. No
priests. A few funeral lamps, hanging here and there from the vaulted
roof, light the room and the staircases feebly. What really lights
the room is the great white cloth in the background, through which
a reddish light shines as if there were a fiery furnace behind. The
room is paved with tombstones. As the curtain rises, the motionless
figure of <span class="sc">The Queen</span> is seen in black outline on this transparent cloth</i></p>


<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="scene"><i><span class="sc">Jane, Joshua.</span> They enter cautiously through a little door behind

<p>Where are we, Joshua?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>No way of getting out of the Tower?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>The people are on guard at every exit. They want to be sure of
getting their criminal this time. No one can go out before the
execution.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>You are sure of it, good Joshua?</p>

<p class="speaker">JOSHUA.</p>

<p>The Tower wasn't surrounded on the waterside. Then, when he started,
the riot wasn't as bad as it was afterward. It was a fine riot, if
you but knew it.</p>

<p>You are sure that he is safe?</p>

frighten you. Don't be afraid. You know the turnkey Eneas betrayed
us. Don't be afraid. I have already told you, child, you have nothing
to fear from me. What was your ruin a month ago is your salvation
to-day. You love Fabiano. There are only you and I in the whole world
to-day who have a heart like that. Only you and I love him. We are
sisters.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Madame&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Yes, you and I&#8212;two women, we are all he has! Every one else is
against him; a whole city, a whole nation, a whole world. Unequal
struggle of love against hate. Love for Fabiano is a sad thing, a
fatal, a horror-stricken thing: it has a pallid brow like yours,
tear-filled eyes like mine; it hides itself close to a funereal
altar; it entreats with your lips, it curses with mine. But hate for
Fabiano is a proud thing, radiant, triumphant: it is well-armed and
victorious; it has the Court, the people, the crowded streets; it
munches cries of death and cries of joy at the same time; it is
magnificent, haughty, powerful; it illuminates a whole city
surrounding a scaffold. Love, here it is&#8212;two women weeping in a
tomb! Hate, there it is!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>She pulls the white cloth violently aside, which reveals a balcony,
and beyond the balcony, almost out of sight, the whole city of
London, brilliantly illuminated. What is visible of the Tower of
London is also illuminated. <span class="sc">Jane</span> fixes her amazed eyes on this
startling scene, the reflection of which lights up the theater.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Oh, infamous city; rebellious city; accursed city; monstrous
city&#8212;who soaks her holiday dress in blood, and who holds the torch
for the executioner! You are afraid of it, aren't you, Jane? Doesn't
it seem to you, as it does to me, that it cowardly defies us both;
that it is watching us with its hundred thousand flaming eyes&#8212;us,
feeble, forsaken women that we are, alone and lost in this sepulcher?
Jane, do you hear it howl and laugh&#8212;that horrible city? Oh, England,
all England to him who will destroy London! Would that I could change
those torches into fiery brands, those lights into flames, and that
illuminated city into a city of <i>fire</i>!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>A tremendous outburst from the people outside&#8212;applause, confused

into a terrible peal of laughter.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>God! The unfortunate man is leaving the Tower!&#8212;You laugh, madame!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Yes, I laugh! [<i>She laughs.</i>] Yes, and you will laugh, too. Let me
drop those hangings first. It seems to me all the time as if we were
not alone, as if that frightful city could see and hear us.</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>She drops the white curtain and comes back to <span class="sc">Jane</span>.</i></p>

<p>Now that he is gone, now that there is no more danger, I can tell you

who drink blood! Oh, it is grand, Jane! Jane, you tremble for
Fabiano? Be at ease, laugh with me, I tell you. Jane, the man they've
got, the man who is going to die, the man they think is Fabiano&#8212;is
not Fabiano.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Not Fabiano?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Then who is it?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>The other!</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>What other?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>You know well enough! You know him&#8212;that workman&#8212;that man. Besides,
what does it matter?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>trembling with terror</i>).</p>

<p>Gilbert?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Yes, Gilbert! That is the name.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Madame! Oh, no, madame! Don't say that, madame! Gilbert&#8212;it would be
too horrible! He has escaped!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>He was escaping when they seized him. They put him under the black
veil in Fabiano's place. It is night. The people won't know. Rest
easy.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>with a frightful cry</i>).</p>

<p>Ah, madame! But the man I love&#8212;it is Gilbert!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What? What do you say? Are you going crazy? Did you deceive me, too?
Ah, it is Gilbert whom you love! Well, what does that matter to me?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE (<i>at <span class="sc">The Queen's</span> feet, broken-hearted, sobbing, dragging
herself on her knees, her hands clasped: the great bell tolls through
all this scene</i>).</p>

<p>Madame&#8212;just for pity! Madame, in the name of Heaven! Madame, by your
crown, by your mother, by the angels! Gilbert, Gilbert&#8212;it will make
me mad! Madame, save Gilbert! That man, he is my life; that man, he
is my husband; that man&#8212; I have told you that he did everything for
me, that he brought me up, that he adopted me, that beside my cradle
he took the place of my father, who died for your father. Madame, you
see that I am a poor, wretched creature, and it isn't right to be too
hard on me. What you said to me just now struck such a terrible blow
that I don't truly see how it is I have strength to speak to you. I
am just saying what I can, you see. But you must stop the
execution&#8212;right away! Stop the execution! Put it off until
to-morrow. Just time to have things understood, that is all. The
people can wait until to-morrow, I know. We will see what we can do.
No! don't shake your head! There is no danger for your Fabiano. You
can put me in his place&#8212;under the black veil&#8212;at night. Who will
know? But you must save Gilbert. What difference does it make whether
it be he or I? And since&#8212;since I want to die! Oh, my God, that bell,
that frightful bell! Every knell of that bell is a step toward the
scaffold. Every knell of that bell strikes me full in the heart. Do
it, madame. Be merciful! No danger for your Fabiano! Let me kiss your
hands. I love you, madame. I never said it before&#8212;but I love you
dearly. You are a great queen. See, how I kiss your beautiful hands!
Give an order to stop the execution. There is time yet. I am sure we
can do it. They go so slowly. It is a long way from the Tower to the
old Market-Place. The man on the balcony said they would pass through
Charing Cross. There is a quicker way. A man on horseback could get
there. In Heaven's name, madame, be merciful! Try to put yourself in
my place. Imagine that I am Queen and you the poor young woman; and
you would weep as I do, and I would pardon. Pardon! Pardon! Oh, that
is what I was afraid of, that my tears would hinder me from speaking!
Oh, right away!&#8212;stop the execution! There won't be any trouble,
madame; no danger for Fabiano, I swear it to you. Don't you really
think you ought to do what I say, madame?</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN (<i>touched and lifting her up</i>).</p>

<p>I wish I could, poor girl. Ah, yes, you are weeping as I wept; what
you feel I have just felt myself, and my anguish makes me understand
yours. Look! I am weeping too. It is very sad, my poor child. It
seems to me, too, they might have taken somebody else&#8212;Tyrconnel, for
instance. But he is too well known: they had to have some obscure
man. He was the only one they could get hold of. I explain all this
so that you can understand, don't you see? My God, there are
fatalities like that: we get caught. We can't do anything.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>I am listening to you, madame. I am like you. I have got many things
to say. But I would like to have the order to suspend the execution
signed, and the man sent off. You see it would be finished then. We
could talk better afterward. Oh, that bell! forever, that bell!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What you want is impossible, Lady Jane.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Oh, no, it is possible!&#8212;a man on horseback. There is a very short
way&#8212;by the wharf. I can go&#8212;I&#8212; It is quite possible! It is easy! You
see I talk very quietly.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>But the people won't have it. They will come back here and massacre
everybody in the Tower. And Fabiano is here yet. Can't you
understand? You are trembling, poor child. I am like you&#8212;I tremble
also. In your turn, put yourself in my place. I might easily not take
the trouble to explain all this to you. You see I do what I can.
Don't think about this Gilbert any more. Jane, it is over&#8212; Resign
yourself.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Over! No, it is not over! No&#8212;as long as that horrible bell tolls, it
is not over! Resign myself to Gilbert's death? Do you think I am
going to let Gilbert die like that? No, madame! Ah, I am wasting my
time! Ah, you won't listen to me! Very well, if the Queen won't hear
me, the people will. They are good, the people&#8212;if you but knew it!
They are in the court yet. You can do what you like with me
afterward. I am going to tell them they are cheated; and that it is
not Fabiani, it's a poor workman, named Gilbert&#8212;a workman like
themselves!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Stop, you wretched child!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>She seizes her arm and looks at her fixedly and resentfully.</i></p>

<p>This is the way you thank me, is it? I am patient and gentle with
you, I weep with you&#8212;and all at once, you get wild and furious!
Well, my love is just as great as yours, and my hand is more
powerful! You shall not stir! Your lover!&#8212;what do I care for your
lover? Are all the girls in England coming to ask me about their
lovers, now? By my soul, I save my own as well as I can, and at the
cost of everything which stands in his way. You must look after
yours.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>Let me go! Oh, I curse you, you wretched, wicked woman!</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Hush!</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>I will not hush! Do you want me to tell you what I'm thinking of now?
I don't believe the man who is going to die out there is my Gilbert.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What are you saying?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>I don't know, but I saw him pass by under that black veil; and if it
had been my Gilbert, something would have stirred in me, something
would have roused itself in my heart, and would have cried out to me,
"Gilbert&#8212;it is Gilbert." But I felt nothing at all; it is not
Gilbert.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>What are you saying? Ah, my God! you are crazy. What you have said is
idiotic, but it terrifies me just the same. Ah, you have roused one
of the secret terrors of my own heart! Why did that riot prevent me
from looking after him myself? Why did I intrust to any one but
myself the safety of my Fabiano? Eneas Dulverton is a traitor.
Perhaps Simon Renard was there. What if I have been betrayed a second
time by Fabiano's enemies? What if it is Fabiano himself? What, ho!
quick&#8212;some one&#8212;come&#8212;some one!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>Two Jailers appear.</i></p>

<p class="staging">[<i>To the first.</i>] You&#8212;run! Here is my royal signet. Tell them to
suspend the execution. To the old Market-Place; to the old
Market-Place! There is a shorter way, you said, Jane.</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>By the wharf.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN (<i>to Jailer</i>).</p>

<p>By the wharf. A horse&#8212;go quick!</p>

<p class="staging">[<i>The Jailer goes out.</i></p>

<p class="staging">[<i>To the second Jailer.</i>] You&#8212;go at once to Edward the Confessor's

<p class="staging">[<i>The Jailer goes out.</i></p>

<p>I tremble; my knees sink under me; I have not strength enough to go
myself. Ah, you have made me as mad as yourself! Miserable girl, you
have made me as wretched as yourself. I curse you as you cursed me.
My God, will the man get there in time? What a torturing anxiety! I
can't see anything more. All is trouble in my soul. Does the bell
toll yet? Is it for Gilbert? Is it for Fabiano?</p>

<p class="speaker">JANE.</p>

<p>The bell ceases.</p>

<p class="speaker">THE QUEEN.</p>

<p>Then the procession is on the place for the execution. Will the man

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
